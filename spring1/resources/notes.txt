java Bean vs Spring Bean
//pojo - plain old java project
	-> No constraint
	->Any java Object is a POJO

//Enterprise Java Bean -> javabean
	-> no arg constructor
	-> getters and setters
	-> serializable
	--> these all make up a java bean
	
// Spring Bean
	->anything maintained by spring is a spring bean
	->spring uses IOC container(Bean Factory or Application Context) to manage these objs
